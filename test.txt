Study Design: Descriptive.
Introduction: Rehabilitation programs that focus on motor recovery of the upper limb require long-term
commitment from the clinicians/therapists, require one-to-one caring, and are usually labor-intensive.
Purpose of the Study: To contribute to this area, we have developed a sensored hand glove integrated with
a computer game (Flappy Bird) to engage patients playing a game where the subject's single/multiple
ﬁngers are involved, representing ﬁne motor skill occupational therapeutic exercises.
Methods: We described the sensored rehab glove, its hardware design, electrical and electronic design
and instrumentation, software design, and pilot testing results.
Results: Experimental results supported that the developed rehab glove system can be effectively used to
engage a patient playing a computer game (or a mobile phone game) that can record the data (ie, game
score, ﬁnger ﬂexion/extension angle, time spent in a therapeutic session, etc.) and put it in a format that
could be easily read by a therapist or displayed to the therapists/patients in different graph formats.
Conclusions: We introduced a sensored rehab glove for home-based therapy. The exercise training using
the glove is repetitious, functional, and easy to follow and comply with.

Introduction
Stroke is one of the leading causes of long-term disability. A
primary concern for stroke survivors is reduced mobility. In fact,
more than 50% of those who are aged 65 years and older and have
survived a stroke are left with impaired mobility.1 According to the
World Health Organization, stroke affects more than 15 million
people worldwide each year.2 Among these, 85% of stroke survivors
will incur arm impairment, and 40% will be chronically impaired or
permanently disabled.3 However, stroke is only one of many causes
of physical disability. A loss or decrease in motor function may
result from spinal cord injuries, cerebral palsy, motor neuron disease, traumatic brain injuries, Parkinson’s disease, sports injury, etc.
It is estimated, more than 3 million people in the USA have a
disability in their hands and/or forearms, including paralyzations,
orthopedic impairments, either congenital or injury related.4 Hand
injuries count for 1/3 of all injuries at work, 1/3 of chronic injuries,

1/4 of lost working time, 1/5 of permanent disability.5 This results in
a burden on their families, communities, and the country as well.
Approximately 50 million family caregivers provide 37 billion hours
of care worth more than an estimated $470 billion annually to their
family and other loved ones.6 The total estimated economic value of
uncompensated care provided by family caregivers surpassed total
Medicaid spending ($449 billion) and nearly equaled the annual
sales ($469 billion) of the four largest U.S. tech companies combined (Apple, HewlettePackard, IBM, and Microsoft).6 These
numbers will continue to rise as the population continues to age.
Biomedical technologies that augment/restore an individual's
upper extremity function have been on the rise in the past decade,
yet are still not able to satisfy the patients' need of restoring lost
upper extremity function. Many advancements have been made to
develop new technology/devices to optimize/enhance the rehabilitation process in relation to comfort, interactive engagement of
patients, price, size, portability, therapist feedback, and effectiveness. Contemporary solutions attempt to satisfy at least one of the
listed criteria. However, this is very inefﬁcient when looking at the
broader scheme of rehabilitation.
Modern rehabilitation applies the principle of neuroplasticity to
repetitive task practice training as the most effective means of

treating the patient. Coupling this with wearable technology, such
as devices that come in the form of gloves, patients with impaired
hand mobility can bolster existing motoneuron connections and
rewire their brains to develop new ones. Research shows that brain
plasticity can be capitalized on to improve rehabilitation efforts and
retrieve biological functionality.7
However, advanced technologies can potentially be used to increase rehabilitation accessibility to the patients, and it can be used
to motivate patients for rehabilitation exercise.8 It is evident from
the recent research results9 that the computer gameebased rehabilitation solutions have the potential of integrating challenging
environments/elements and offering motivation into the therapy
routines, thereby increasing patient inspiration to follow through
with previously tedious tasks. For these reasons, interactive computer gaming technology has gained attention as a component of
rehabilitation. In past decades, Alankus et al,9 Annet et al,10 Shah
et al,11 and several others developed different types of game-based
rehabilitation systems for the rehabilitation of human upper extremity. While novel ground work, these systems have room for
improvement in ordr to make therapy more entertaining, engaging,
user-friendly, and challenging.12,13 It is worth noting that patients
prefer to perform game-based rehabilitation exercises at home for
long-term recovery.14
The literature review reveals that several hand rehabilitation
devices have been recently developed to improve weakness, loos
of coordination, or impaired dexterity. For example, Sasidharan
et al15 developed a smart glove with the use of resistive strip
sensors to analyze the ﬂexion and extension of the index ﬁnger
and the wrist. During testing with this glove, many design ﬂaws
were noted and several were adapted during testing to improve
the function of the glove. Results of the testing showed that the
glove could detect wrist and index ﬁnger extensions but that the
sensitivity had to be calibrated for each patient. Similarly, a group
of researchers at the Sapienza University16 used two LEAP Motion
controllers positioned orthogonally to create a virtual glove to
assist patients recovering from a stroke. They have used 3dimensional multisensor technology to map the movement and
function of the hand. However, the experimental data to observe
the behavior of the system reveals, both in the infrared interferences and in the reference system roto-translation experiments, the discrepancy of the data was observed because of an
intrinsic lack of accuracy of the LEAP sensor along the Z direction.
Taking a mechanical approach to stroke recovery, Hong Kai et al17
have developed a soft pneumatic glove. Their pilot test results
reveal that the glove is able to provide grasping assistance to the
hand to augment the stroke survivor's motion. Future work with
this glove include adding objective measures such as force, range
of motion (ROM), grip strength, and so forth. Recently, a group of
researchers devised the MusicGlove18 that is intended for the
same purpose as the other projects listed. Using an interactive
gameebased therapy, the MusicGlove is a glove that senses the
repetitive performance of pinching exercises and therefore it
cannot provide individual/multiﬁnger ﬂexion/extension exercises.
These are just a few of the many examples of research contributions to this area in the ﬁeld within the past few years. A limitation
in the majority of these examples is that they lack visual feedback
to its users; ﬂexibility of multiﬁnger motion exercise; ability to
provide the therapist with objective data such as individual's
progress/recovery, increase of ROM, time taken to perform a
functional task, and so forth. Thus, measures of how effective the
therapy is to the patients reveal that enhanced motor learning
occurs in the ‘active rehabilitation therapy’ mode, when patients
(independently) practice a variety of functional tasks.19 Therefore,
in this research, we have developed a novel rehabilitation scheme
with a game-interfaced sensored rehab glove. Our compact glove

has the capability of engaging a patient playing a computer game
(or a mobile phone game) that will record the data and put it in a
format that could be easily read by a clinician or displayed to the
clinicians in different graph formats. Some of the features of this
glove include its portability, size, price, therapist feedback, and
patient engagement.
In the next section of this article, a detailed overview of the
design and development (hardware design/fabrication, electrical
instrumentation, and software development) of the proposed
sensored rehabilitation glove is presented. Experimental results
with the developed sensored rehab glove interfaced with a game are
presented in Experiment and Results section. Finally, the article
ends with a conclusion and future research works in Conclusion
section.
Sensored rehab glove
The proposed sensored glove is designed to be integrated with a
computer game to engage patients in a therapeutic session where a
patient plays a game during which single/multiple ﬁnger ﬂexion/
extension motions are required. The integrated system (sensored
glove þ game) provides (a) real-time data to the patients about
their performance (eg, an increase of ROM) and (b) detailed analysis
of the patient's progression to the therapist. The glove is designed
for the patients to step outside of the therapist's ofﬁce and still be
able to proceed with the training exercises in a way that is motivating. However, therapists still play an integral part by monitoring
their progress, directing them through the activities, and correcting
the patient's mistakes during follow-ups.
Hardware design of proposed sensored rehab glove
When designing a device that will be used for a clinical purpose
on individuals who lack certain abilities, it is crucial to adapt the
design to the user's needs. Convenience, portability, and comfort
were the three primary factors that we took into account during the
development of the proposed sensored rehab glove. Typically, a
glove is a garment (Fig. 1A) that covers the entire hand. Considering
that we are working with the hand, it seemed most logical to use a
glove. The glove that we have chosen ﬁts each ﬁnger snug so that
the ﬂexing of each ﬁnger is most accurately represented through
the bend in the glove. The glove is loose enough so that the hand
can slide in with ease and there is minimal need for the gloved hand
to cooperate while putting it on. Five ﬂex sensors (one for each
ﬁnger, as shown in Figs. 1A and 1B) have been instrumented on the
glove to measure the ﬂexion/extension of the ﬁnger.
Note that, we fabricated a small pocket onto each ﬁnger of the
glove so that the ﬂex sensor does not have any room to wiggle or
slip out. These pockets were sewn closed to ensure that the ﬂex
sensors do not come out. For demonstration purpose, the ﬂex
sensors’ instrumentation on the glove is illustrated in Figure 1A. An
elastic Velcro strap at the wrist ensures that the glove stays on tight
and does not move around as it is being used to play the game.
In a normally functioning hand, the metacarpophalangeal (MCP)
joints are independent of the distal interphalangeal (DIP) and the
proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints. In addition, the DIP and PIP
joints are both usually ﬂexing simultaneously. Therefore, this type
of sensor (Flex Sensor) is not entirely an accurate representation of
the angle at which the ﬁnger is bending because it does not take
each joint into consideration. Instead, the sensor detects overall
ﬂexion as shown in Figure 2. Therefore, the angle that the sensor
reads could be interpreted as the combination of MCP, DIP, and PIP
joint angles (for the thumb, it will be the combination of
interphalangeal (IP) and thumb's metacarpophalangeal (MCPT)

joint angles). Figure 2A shows the schematic of a ﬂex sensor's
resting state (angle 180 ) and its fully ﬂexed state (angle 0 ).
Hard exoskeletal devices are commonly known for becoming
uncomfortable after prolonged use. An experimental comfort
assessment has shown that rigid devices create signiﬁcant
discomfort and limit the range of movement.20 Similar to modern
trends, we have fabricated the glove from soft materials, to ensure
comfort throughout the training session. Essentially, when the
glove is on the hand, the patient will not even realize it. Moreover,
the utilization of a Bluetooth module, a compact design, and
development of a versatile software make this very lightweight and
portable. The developed sensored glove can be used at home so that
repetitive task practice is maintained and the rate of neuroplasticity
is maximized outside of the therapist's ofﬁce.

Electrical and electronic design and instrumentation
The electronic hardware design is built on the Arduino Nano21
open-source microcontroller as depicted in Figure 3. This made it
easy to acquire ﬂex sensor angles (ie, combined MCP, PIP, and DIP
ﬂexion/extension angles). Five resistive ﬂex sensors are run
through with a standard voltage of 5 V. As shown in Figure 2A,
when a ﬂex sensor is in its ﬂat/resting orientation (ie, when the
MCP, PIP, and DIP joints are in resting state as shown in Fig. 2B), it
has a resistance of 25 KU. When the ﬂex sensor is ﬂexing (ie, when
the ﬁnger is ﬂexing), the resistance of the sensor increases; and in a
fully ﬂexed position of the sensor (ie, fully ﬂexed position of a ﬁnger
as shown in Fig. 2C), the resistance of the ﬂex sensor increases to
125 KU, which is a 0 pinch bend as shown in Figure 2A. Therefore,

this sensor is capable of capturing the full motions of both ﬂexion
and extension of individual ﬁngers.
A Bluetooth module embedded Arduino Nano transmits the raw
data from the glove's sensors to the USB dongle on the computer. As
discussed previously, wireless communication between the glove
and the computer makes the glove more convenient and eliminates
the risk of tangled wires.
The utilization of a Bluetooth module proved to be as easy as
creating a glove that was tethered to a computer (also can be
tethered to a smartphone). The USB dongle is the receiver for the
Bluetooth connection and receives all of the analog signals from the
ﬂex sensors representing ﬂexion/extension of MCP/PIP/DIP joint
angles. The Arduino Nano itself is the transmitter, sending the raw
analog signals that are captured from the glove. The connection
between these two devices automatically takes place once the
dongle is in the USB port of the computer and the Arduino is
switched on and connected to power, ultimately eliminating the
need to pair the two Bluetooth devices. Note that, the raw analog
signals acquired from the ﬂex sensors are ﬁltered before producing
the desired results showing the ﬂexion/extension angles of the
ﬁngers, that is, our key objective measures of a therapeutic session
using the developed sensored glove.

There are two separate programs to the software side of this
project, (a) the Arduino programming (microcontroller programming) and (b) the game-interface development. The ﬁrst part of the
program (Arduino programming) records the live (real-time) data
from the glove of each ﬁnger's ﬂexion/extension, sensed by the
resistive ﬂex sensors. These ﬂex senor data are then converted and
mapped to the corresponding ﬁnger ﬂexion/extension angle. Later,
the Arduino program compiles the mapped data along with a
unique identiﬁer and sends those to a separate program called
‘Processing’.22 Processing is a language that was built based on the
Java Language with simpliﬁed syntax. The Processing receives the
data, parses the unique identiﬁer from the numerical value, and
stores it as an integer. The Flappy Bird game,23 which was developed in Processing, is then able to easily interpret the ﬁnger ﬂexion/
extension angle through the basic logic and conditional statements.
The objective of making this game is to drive the subjects to work/
play with their ﬁngers in a full ROM.
Flappy Bird is one of the most popular and addictive gamesapproximately 18 million people have played this game.24 It is an
open-source game that is why one can use its source code and
modify it to add new features. In a traditional Flappy Bird type
game, the player has full control over the bird's height. However, in
our developed version, the user controls the bird's entrance in
between the green tubes (see Fig. 4). It appeared very difﬁcult to
control the bird's ﬂaps through the glove itself. Therefore, this
alternative solution allows for simplicity for those with impaired,
weak muscle function. When an individual (wearing the glove)
starts a therapeutic session with this game, two green tubes and a
name of a ﬁnger appear to play the game (Fig. 4). The individual
must bend (ﬂex/extend) that ﬁnger completely to the best of their
ability to lift the bird to a height in between the green tubes as the
bird crosses the tubes. As shown in Figure 4A, the game asks the
player to ﬂex her pinky ﬁnger to the best of their ability. Each
successful attempt at bending the ﬁnger while crossing the tubes
will result in their score to increase by one. However, if the individual fails to bend (ﬂex/extend) that particular ﬁnger within an
allowable range, then the game will end and their score will be
displayed. Also, if the individual bends (ﬂex/extend) other ﬁngers
beyond the allowable range, the game will end immediately
showing ‘wrong ﬁnger movement.’ Therefore, a player can not cheat
the game. For instance, in Figure 4C, the player did not ﬂex the ring

Fig. 4. Three screenshots of the game are presented to show what the game looks like and how it functions. (A) This screenshot depicts a player with a score of 4 points, and the
game asks the player to ﬂex her pinky ﬁnger; (B) this screenshot presents a multiﬁnger motion exercise that the player must perform; (C) this screenshot shows the game has ended
after the player made an error.

ﬁnger and, therefore, the game ended. The goal is to make an
entertaining and engaging environment of providing therapeutic
exercise for individuals with loss of motor function in the hand.
Therefore, the game gets progressively more difﬁcult as the player
advances through the game. For example, in our default setting, if a
player scores 10, the game will require him/her to coordinate with
more than one ﬁnger. This case is presented in Figure 4B as the
game requires the player to ﬂex both their index and ring ﬁnger
simultaneously. The program includes all possible combinations of
two ﬁngers and multiﬁnger ﬂexion/extension motions. This allows
for the patient to perform complex ﬁnger motions when they are
suited to go to that stage. The game can be played either on a
computer or on a feature phone/smartphone/tablet. Provisions
included in the game (a) to set up the time limit, or allow players to
play as long as they want; (b) customize the difﬁculty level
threshold (default setting is level 1 for score less than 10; level 2:
scores from 10 to 20; level 3: score >20); (c) customize the single
and multiﬁnger repetitions (default setting is randomly selected);
(d) slow/speed up the game (to facilitate slow or fast ﬂexion/
extension of ﬁnger); and (e) reverse the game control for poststroke
patients with ﬂexure contractures where an individual must extend
his/her ﬁnger completely to the best of their ability to lift the bird to
a height in between the green tubes as the bird crosses the tubes.
Each time a patient plays the game, the score will be recorded in
a ﬁle that the therapist can access. This provides the patient with
information such as the maximum degrees the ﬁnger was bent, the
minimum it was bent, the score of each game, and the date/time
the game was played. The physical or the occupational therapist
may use this information to track the patient's progress over time
to evaluate the extent to which the patient has progressed and
beneﬁted through the therapy.
Experiment and results
The glove concept is based on the idea that exercises that engage
individuals during the practice of motor activities are often beneﬁcial for neurorehabilitation as shown through numerous
studies.25 When these practices are implemented with repetition
and complexity, they prove to be effective.26 The entire outline of
the therapeutic process with the glove is illustrated in Figure 5. An
individual will play an open-source game named Flappy Bird

5

wearing a sensored glove. The game was adapted and customized
for the developed sensored glove system. The glove will wirelessly
transmit experiment data (ie, the ﬂex-sensor signals) to the computer/smartphone (where the game runs) as the control input for
the game. As mentioned earlier, the ﬂex sensors are attached to
each ﬁnger of the glove and provide the ﬂexion/extension information of the ﬁnger. As shown in Figure 5, this information is then
interpreted by the program and converted into a ﬂexion/extension
angle (in degrees) that the ﬁnger is bent to identify the instantaneous position of the ﬁngers. In the game interface, the ﬂexion/
extension angle determines the ﬂying height of the bird on the
screen. Moreover, this position information of the ﬁngers will allow
the computer to determine whether the user is performing the task
with accuracy. If the accuracy is poor, then the game interface will
provide visual feedback to the user alerting them that they have
made a mistake. The session data are compiled and placed in a log
ﬁle. This log will be used by the therapist to analyze the patient's
performance and make any adjustments as needed.
To demonstrate the proof of concept (as well as to evaluate the
performance of the developed ‘game-interfaced sensored glove system’), an experiment was designed with three healthy subjects
(subject 1: age 17 years (male); subject 2: age 37 years (female);
and subject 3: age 44 years (male)).
When considering the presented data, it should be noted that
each individual possessed varying video game experience. In
addition, because the subjects of the experiment were healthy and
possessed no physical disabilities, the performance would theoretically be much better than that of a patient. This game was
designed for those with motor disabilities; thus, the simplicity of
the game was of high priority. Therefore, the results themselves
should not be considered with high importance. The subjects put
the glove on and played the game ten times each. Results were then
plotted on a graph showing the dates/time and the duration the
game was played, the score that they received, and the complete
history of ﬁngers ﬂexion/extension angles. Figure 6 display the
score that subjects received after they had played the game each
day. Tables 1e3 were obtained from the data log of the game. From
this data log, a therapist can monitor how often a patient has
participated in the game (therapeutic session), the time he/she
spent in the sessions, and so forth. As shown in Figure 6A, subject 1
did not play the game on March 31st. Also, it will help the therapist

to track the progress of the patients. Here, in Figure 6A, a slight
upward trend could be noticed; this may be the result of a better
understanding of the game over time. The data are presented
simply to demonstrate how the patient's progress will be tracked
and how the therapist could potentially interpret this information.
From the data log, a therapist can quantitatively measure the
subject's progress by analyzing the subject's ﬁnger ﬂexion/extension
angles for each session the subject has played the game.

Experimental results of three different subjects playing the game
are shown in Figures 8-11, where subjects' ﬁnger ﬂexion/extension
angles are plotted from the data log of a few randomly selected
game sessions. Figure 7 explains how to interpret the results of
Figures 8-11. It can be seen from Figure 7 that a plot (dotted line)
from the area of red line (180 ) toward the green line (0 ) indicates
the ﬁnger has bent from its extension position (180 ) to ﬂex position (0 ), whereas a plot (dotted line) from the area of green line

(0 ) toward the red line indicates the ﬁnger has bent from its ﬂexed
position (0 ) to extension position (180 ).
As mentioned earlier, the proposed rehabilitation scheme can be
facilitated both for ﬁnger ﬂexion and extension movement in the
game. Figure 8 shows the experimental results, where the subject
conducts ﬁnger extension motion (to lift the bird) to play the game.
Whereas, in Figures 9 and 11, the subjects perform ﬁnger ﬂexion
motion (to lift the bird) to play the game. Based on the subject's
ﬁnger impairment, a therapist can prescribe the ﬂexion or extension motion the subject should choose to play the game. As shown
in Figure 8B, all the scoring ﬁnger movement (seven times, as
shown in Fig. 8B) occurred when joint angle moves from near 0 to
near 180 degree and all initial joint angles are in near 0 , which
indicates ﬁnger motion from ﬂexed position toward an extension.
Whereas in Figures 9 and 11, a reverse ﬁnger motion produces a
score, that is, ﬁnger ﬂexion motion from its extension position will
produce a score. Note that, in our default game setting, instruction
for multiﬁnger motion appears when a subject reaches a score of
10, but provision has been included in the game to change the
difﬁculty level threshold as desired (by the therapists/subjects).
Game difﬁculty levels are described in the following:
 Difﬁculty level 1: This is our default game setting for a score of
less than 10. At this setting, a random ﬁnger name appears on the
screen. The subject must ﬂex/extend that ﬁnger to play the game.
 Difﬁculty level 2: When a subject scores 9, the default setting of
the difﬁculty level moves to the level 2, where two ﬁngers'
simultaneous movement is required to play the game. At this
setting, a random combination of two ﬁngers' names appears on
the screen. The subject must ﬂex/extend those two ﬁngers to play
the game.
 Difﬁculty level 3: When a subject scores 20, the default setting of
the difﬁculty level moves to level 3, where three ﬁngers' simultaneous movement often required to play the game. At this
setting, a random combination of three ﬁngers' names often
appears on the screen. The subject must ﬂex/extend those three
ﬁngers to play the game.

From Figure 8B, it is clearly evident that there were seven instances in that session where ﬁnger extension motion happened as
can be seen from the seven peaks which have resulted in a score of
7. It can be also observed from Figure 8B that there were no overlapping peaks in that session, that is, there is no simultaneous
motion of multiﬁngers involved in that session.
Experimental results with subject 2 are presented in Figures 9 and
10. The Figure 9 demonstrates a different scenario where simultaneous motions of two ﬁngers (index and pinky) toward the complete
ﬂexion motion are observed in the game (for the ﬁrst time) around at
26 sec (as evident from the overlapping double peaks) when the
subject reached the difﬁculty level 2, that is, after scoring points 9 (ie,
after 9 nonoverlapping peaks). A few more two ﬁngers’ simultaneous
movements but with the different combinations of two ﬁngers are
observed from 26 sec to 45 secs (as evident from the double peaks,
scores: 10-16). Figure 10 shows the results of the same experiments
presented in Figure 9, but the results are plotted separately for one
ﬁnger ﬂexion/extension motion in Figure 10A, and two ﬁngers’
simultaneous ﬂexion/extension motion in Figure 10B.
Experimental results with subject 3 are presented in Figure 11,
where a simultaneous motion of three ﬁngers has appeared (at
around 64 sec) when the subject reached the difﬁculty level 3 (ie, after
scoring the 20 points). It is also seen (in Fig. 11) as the score increased,
not only the complex ﬁnger combination appeared on the game but
also the speed of the game increased, thus providing a more challenging environment to the participant. Note that, a therapist can set
the speed of the game for different score levels, or set up a steady
speed for all the levels depending on the patient's condition.

Fig. 8. The experimental result with subject 1 scored 7 on March 24th for ﬁnger extension movement; (A) individual ﬁnger movement plots; (B) results shown in panel (A) are
plotted in one graph. No simultaneous motion of multiﬁngers can be seen on panel (B) as the subject's score was less than 10.

It is obvious from all the results (Figs. 8, 9, and 11) that for a
particular ﬁnger motion, a few other ﬁngers also show some
movements. This is due to the dependence of a ﬁnger motion on
other ﬁngers. For a stroke patient, this dependence will be much
more severe. In this rehabilitation scheme, the developed game
includes some provisions where a therapist can adjust how much
ﬂexion/extension movements of the dependent ﬁnger should be
allowed for a particular patient so that the game can go on without
showing ‘wrong ﬁnger movement’ (an example of this case is presented in Fig. 4C). The therapist also needs to deﬁne the amount of
ﬂexion/extension angle for the ﬁngers of the patient to consider as
a successful ﬂexion/extension to lift the bird in the game. In our
experiments, we have considered a ﬁnger ﬂexion/extension angle
greater than 60 as a successful movement to play the game, and
the dependent ﬁnger movement should be less than 50 , otherwise
the game will end with the message ‘Wrong Finger.’
Experimental results presented in Figures 8-11 reveal that the
developed rehab glove system can be effectively used to engage an

individual in playing a computer game (or a mobile phone game)
that can record the data (ie, game score, ﬁnger ﬂexion/extension
angle, time spent in a therapeutic session, etc.) and put it in a
format that could be easily read by a therapist or displayed to the
therapists/patients in different graph formats.
Conclusion
In this article, we presented an engaging rehabilitation method
for individuals with hand dysfunction. A sensored glove was
developed to detect ﬁnger ﬂexion/extension motion and was integrated with a computer game named ‘Flappy Bird.’ The game has
been customized to play with the developed sensored glove. The
glove wirelessly sends the ﬁnger ﬂexion/extension data to the game.
In a therapeutic session, an individual plays the game by ﬂexing/
extending his or her ﬁngers. Based on the user's performance/
progress (game score determines the performance) the difﬁculty
level of the game changes intelligently to engage the user with the

more challenging tasks (where multiﬁnger motions are required to
play the game). The game can be played either on a computer or on a
smartphone. Provisions included in the game (a) to set up the time
limit; (b) customize the difﬁculty level; (c) customize the single and
multiﬁnger repetitions; (d) slow/speed up the game (to facilitate
slow or fast ﬂexion/extension of ﬁnger); and (e) reverse the game
control for poststroke patients with ﬂexure contractures where an
individual must extend his/her to play the game. To demonstrate the
proof of concept (as well as to evaluate the performance of the
developed ‘game-interfaced sensored glove system’), an experiment
was conducted with the healthy subjects where the users play the
developed game wearing the sensored glove. In the experiments,
subjects' ﬁnger joint ﬂexion/extension angle and game scores are
recorded. Experimental results reveal that the developed rehab
glove system can be effectively used to engage a patient playing a
computer game (or a mobile phone game) that can record the data
(game score, ﬁnger ﬂexion/extension angle, etc.) and put it in a
format that could be easily read by a therapist or displayed to the
therapists/patients in different graph formats.

The developed system will enable the therapists to monitor the
patient's progress through the player's score in the game that is
recorded in a progressive log. This method of rehabilitation rests on
the idea that through repetitive task practice and through making
the patient attempt progressively more complex hand positions,
they will undergo neuroplasticity at a faster rate and regain dexterity in each individual ﬁnger. In addition, by being able to continue
the progress and play the game at home, therapeutic sessions are
not conﬁned to the therapist's ofﬁce. Most importantly, with this
method of therapeutic approach, patients will avoid potentially
monotonous tasks and remain engaged in their rehabilitation.
In future work, a study with actual patients who suffer from a
motor impairment of the upper limb will be conducted over an
extended period of time. Experiments using test subjects rather
than healthy controls will allow for better feedback on the efﬁciency of the glove. In addition, we will expand the software to
make the glove compatible with a variety of more engaging video
games. Eventually, incorporating virtual reality games would make
the treatment process more engaging and potentially even make

rehabilitation more efﬁcient. As this glove is developed, long-term
studies will be performed to determine the efﬁciency, successes,
and drawbacks of this type of repetitive task practice training for
hand rehabilitation.
