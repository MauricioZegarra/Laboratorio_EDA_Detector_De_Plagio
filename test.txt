Abstract— People with stroke typically must perform much
of their hand exercise at home without professional assistance
as soon as two weeks after the stroke. Without feedback and
encouragement, individuals often lose motivation to practice
using the affected hand, and this disuse contributes to further
declines in hand function. We developed the MusicGlove as a
way to facilitate and motivate at home practice of hand
movement. This low-cost device uses music as an interactive
and motivating medium to guide hand exercise and to
quantitatively assess hand movement recovery. It requires the
user to practice functional movements, including pincer grip,
key-pinch grip, and finger-thumb opposition, by using those
movements to play different musical notes, played along to
songs displayed by an interactive computer game. We report
here the design of the glove and the results of a single-session
experiment with 10 participants with chronic stroke. We found
that the glove is well suited for use by people with an
impairment level quantified by a Box and Blocks score of at
least around 7; that the glove can be used to obtain a measure
of hand dexterity (% of notes hit) that correlates strongly with
the Box and Blocks score; and that the incorporation of music
into training significantly improved both objective measures of
hand motor performance and self-ratings of motivation for
training in the single session.
I. INTRODUCTION
Stroke remains the leading cause of chronic adult
disability in Western countries with over four million
survivors currently living in the United States [1]. Following
the onset of stroke, up to 85% of patients exhibit initial hand
motor impairment for the first few weeks, and up to 75% six
months post initial assessment [2]-[4]. Intensive movement
training can reduce motor impairment after stroke [5].
Unfortunately, the length of stay at inpatient rehabilitation
facilities is now often limited to two weeks and outpatient

physical therapy to two times a week thereafter [6]. Patients
are therefore expected to perform intensive therapy at home
with little direct supervision during the time window when
the brain is most plastic [7]. Current home hand therapy
typically consists of patients following through written
sheets of exercises [8]. Without feedback and a motivating
context for exercise, people often cease exercising the hand.
Repetitive massed practice of movements and the
intensity of movement are two of the most important factors
for regaining motor function [9]-[11]. Music is a promising
avenue for therapy because of its highly repetitive and
motivating nature [9], [12]. Moreover, music therapy has
been hypothesized to induce better cortical connectivity and
improve motor cortex activation [9], [13]. Recognizing these
potential benefits, several forms of music based therapy have
emerged which focus on movement repetition and auditory
feedback about movement precision [9], [12], [14].

Technology for music-based therapy of hand movement is
also emerging. For example, one study used a customized
electronic keyboard and drum pad designed to train both fine
as well as gross hand movement [9]. In another study,
participants used a robotic and virtual system to play a
simulated piano with the intent of training hand function
[16]. Although these devices promote recovery of hand
function, they do not specifically train the hand movements
used in activities of daily living (ADLs).
Our working hypothesis is that a musical training device
that focuses on training functional hand movements will be
more effective than a device that does not train such
movements, due to the principle of specificity of motor
training [17]. In other words, we hypothesize that people
will improve function more if they practice the actual
movements required for function.
We therefore developed MusicGlove as a low cost device
(< $100) for home hand rehabilitation. MusicGlove uses
music as an interactive and motivating medium for therapy
and to gain a quantitative assessment of the user’s progress.
In addition, we designed MusicGlove to require performance
of functional gripping movements to play musical notes;
these movements include pincer grip, key-pinch grip, and
finger-thumb opposition.
The device presented here is similar to another glove
based hand therapy device known as the HandTutor [18].
However, based on the published report of its use, the
HandTutor does not appear to be focused on using musical
training for therapy. The HandTutor also focuses on finger
range of motion exercises rather than on having the user
complete pinch and grasp functions that are used in many
ADLs.
This paper describes the design of the MusicGlove and the
results of initial single-session testing with the device. In this
testing, we sought to understand what level of impairment
the device was suited to treat; whether the quantitative
measurements from the glove correlated with clinical scales
of hand function; and whether people found the musical
context for therapy motivating.
II. METHODS
A. Device Design
MusicGlove is composed of a glove designed to train
functional hand movements through interactive music-based
computer games.
1) Glove
The glove contains six electrical leads located on all five
fingertips and one on the proximal interphalangeal joint on
the lateral aspect of the index finger. When the lead on the
thumb touches any of the other five leads, an electrical
connection is closed which is then registered by the
computer as an event. The placement of the electrical leads
forces the patient to engage in pinch and grasp motions
associated with activities of daily living (ADLs), as well as
thumb-finger opposition [19].
We have initially designed MusicGlove to be used to play
music on a pentatonic scale, common in Rock and Blues
music. Fig. 1a shows the five movements that correspond to
the five musical notes. It is possible to incorporate more
notes by combining finger movements or placing more
leads, or by using sensing of hand orientation to influence
note selection.
2) USB-Controller
A USB-controller was built to interface the glove with a
computer. A PIC18F14K50 microcontroller sends a unique
output to the computer corresponding to each of the five
digital inputs it receives.
B. Software
The MusicGlove is interfaced with a modified version of
Frets on Fire (FOF)—an open source computer game similar
to Guitar Hero©. During this game, five distinct notes scroll
from the top to bottom of the screen (Fig 1b). When a note
touches the stars at the bottom of the screen, the user has a
300ms window to touch the thumb to the specific electrical
lead associated with that note. Each note is synchronized
with a song in order to create the perception of playing the
song with the glove. The goal of the game is to correctly hit
as many notes as possible by the end of the level.
In order to use FOF for hand rehabilitation, several
modifications were made to the source code. First, the
graphical user interface and song selection were
reconfigured towards people over age 50, as this is the
predominant age range for people with stroke. When
developing the songs, the difficulty level of each song was
also configured to match the skill level of individuals with
different levels of hand impairment. Moreover, the computer
game was modified to enable both user and therapist to gain
a quantitative assessment of motor function at the end of
each song. The MusicGlove quantitative assessment shows:
the number of correct notes hit on each fret, total number of
correct notes hit, and an average of how close in time the
individual was to hitting the note at the correct time.
Specifically, the timing term is calculated as:
(1)
Where X = deviation in time of a correctly hit note (has to be
within 300ms window to be considered correct), and n = the
total number of correctly hit notes in a level.
C. Participants
A total of 10 participants who had experienced a stroke
within the past three years were enrolled in the study (mean
duration past stroke = 41.8 months +/- 15.6 SD). All
participants had severe to moderate hand impairment as a
result of stroke (Box & Block Test 0-46; 60 = normal).
2360
Participants provided informed consent according to the
protocol approved by the U.C. Irvine Institutional Review
Board.
D. Procedure
Motor function was first assessed using the Box & Blocks
test by a trained physical therapist [15]. This assessment,
which requires the testee to grab, move over a barrier, and
drop as many blocks as possible in a one minute period, is
widely used in motor rehabilitation of the upper extremity,
and has good reliability and validity. Next, each participant
donned the glove and was instructed how to generate an
event by correctly touching the thumb to one of the five
leads. The participant then played a tutorial in FOF that
explained how to correctly match each of the five events
with the five notes on the screen. The participants then
began the training phase. Half of the participants played a
level associated with the song Can’t Help Falling in Love
three times with music and then three times without music
(i.e. with the speaker turned off, but still with the graphical
interface showing the desired notes). The other group played
Can’t Help Falling in Love three times without music
followed by three times with music. The trial was 2 minutes
59 seconds in duration and contained a total of 82 notes, of
which 28, 27, 27, 0, 0 of the notes were located on frets 1-5
respectfully. Participants were given a maximum of one
minute in between trials. At the end of each trial, the
MusicGlove quantitative assessment was recorded. After all
six trials were completed, the participants were asked to fill
a questionnaire about their experience with the device.
III. RESULTS
A. Comparison of MusicGlove quantitative assessment
with an established clinical measure of hand function
Fig. 2 Shows the average percent of total notes hit versus the
Box and Blocks score of each of the 10 participants in the
study. There was a significant linear relationship between
MusicGlove performance in FOF and Box and Block score
(β = 0.51, t(9) = 10.76, p<0.001, r2
= 0.79). Note that two
of the 10 participants enrolled in the study could not
participate in the training phase due to an inability to close
the contacts between the thumb and other leads. These
participants had Box and Blocks scores of 0 and 2. A third
participant with a Box and Blocks score of 7 was able to
participate in the training phase.
Fig. 2. Average percent of total notes hit significantly predicts box and
block score, β = 0.51, t(9) = 10.76, p<0.001, r2
= 0.79. Error bars
represent one standard deviation.
B. Role of music in motor performance and motivation
Participants attempted to perform the gripping
movements with and without the musical feedback; in both
cases they received graphical feedback from the computer
screen about the desired notes and success in hitting those
desired notes with the correct timing. Participants scored on
average 10% higher, in terms of percentage of musical notes
successfully played, when receiving music feedback (paired
t-test, t(7) = 2.38, p = 0.048).
Fig. 3. Participants on average performed 10% better in FOF level with
music than without (paired t-test, t(7) = 2.38, p = 0.048). The thin lines
represent the outcome of each participant. The thick line represents the
average of these results.
We also evaluated the average note timing term ( ) with
and without music. As seen in fig. 4, participants on average
did not show any significant difference in timing when
playing the levels with and without music (paired t-test, t(7)
= 0.43, p = 0.435).
2361
Fig. 4. Comparison of average note timing with and without music.
Participants did not show a significant difference in the timing of hit note
with and without music (paired t-test, t(7) = 0.43, p= 0.435). The thin lines
represent the outcome of each participant. The thick line represents the
average of these results.
Fig. 5 shows the adaptation to playing FOF over the six
trials. On average, participants improved in total amount of
hit notes by 19.9% (SD = 18.5) from the first trial to the last.
A paired t-test revealed a highly significant improvement in
percent of total notes hit from the first trial to last, t(7) =
3.94, p<0.001.
Fig. 5. Percent total notes hit for each trial increases on average over the
length of the training regimen. The thin lines represent the outcome of each
participant. The thick line represents the average of these results.
After the training session, we asked participants to
complete a survey evaluating their experience (fig. 6). They
found the training motivating, challenging, and desirable for
home use. The participants found training with music to be
significantly more motivating than training without music
(paired t-test, t(7) = 5.6, p<0.001).
Fig. 6. MusicGlove questionnaire shows that individuals approve of the
therapy, and find it motivating. Participants found therapy with music to be
more motivating than therapy without music (paired t-test, t(7) = 5.6,
p<0.001). Error bars represent one standard deviation.
IV. DISCUSSION
We developed a low-cost device that senses when people
complete functional grips, including pincer grip, key pinch,
and thumb-finger opposition. We interfaced the glove to a
music game that requires the player to try to play notes along
to songs using the functional grips. We tested the glove in a
single session test with 10 people with a chronic stroke. The
findings from this test and their significance are as follows.
First, we found that the glove is suitable for use by people
with an impairment level quantified by a Box and Blocks
score of approximately 7 or above. This means that the glove
is suitable for people who have a moderate to low level of
hand impairment. Note that all individuals who were able to
use the glove to play music were able to don it without
assistance; thus the glove is suitable for home-use by the
population who can engage in its training paradigm. We are
currently working on a robotic version of the glove that
could assist people with a more severe level of hand
impairment in using the same musical paradigm to exercise
[20].
Second, we found that the glove can be used to obtain a
measure of hand dexterity (% of notes hit) that correlates
strongly with the Box and Blocks score. Since Box and
Block score is an established indicator of hand motor
function, this strong correlation indicates that MusicGlove
can provide an objective measure of hand function.
Moreover, this correlation suggests that improvement in
MusicGlove performance will in turn lead to improved hand
function.
Third, the use of music for training significantly improved
both objective measures of hand motor performance and
self-ratings of motivation for training. This finding suggests
that patients will be both more engaged in the task during
training and will be motivated to perform the therapy for
long durations. Note that music improved the ability to hit
the right note with the right grip, but did not improve timing.
This result is contrary to previous findings [7]. A larger
2362
sample size is needed in order to validate this finding.
In conclusion, the MusicGlove was shown to be a
motivating device for repetitive training of functional hand
grips. Moreover, music was found to significantly increase
the performance and motivation of the participants.
Longitudinal clinical trials will be implemented to test
whether training with the MusicGlove improves hand
function after stroke.
